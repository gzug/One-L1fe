# CHECKPOINT.md

## Verdict

The current session closed the wearable sync seam further: `WearableSyncScreen` now builds a real Health Connect observation request through `apps/mobile/healthConnectCollector.ts` and submits it through the shared wearable sync contract. The mobile permission surface was widened to include `RestingHeartRate` and `HeartRateVariabilityRmssd`, and the wearable docs/assertions now align to the canonical metric keys.

Remaining gaps: physical Garmin/Health Connect testing and end-to-end Supabase ingest proof on an Android device. The stale GitHub cleanup pass is complete and the local worktree is back on a clean `main` baseline.

## Current state

- Branch state: `main`, aligned with `origin/main`
- Active seam: physical-device Health Connect ingest proof

## Pending PRs

- `claude/real-app-install-id` — AsyncStorage-backed persistent UUID replacing `MOCK_APP_INSTALL_ID`; pending merge (intentionally held)
- `#99 feat: user-configurable panel preferences` — still open and draft; not cleaned up in this pass
- `#101 feat: mobile scoring and build tooling` — still open and draft; not cleaned up in this pass

## Blockers

- No physical Garmin / Health Connect data source proof yet (WEARABLE-TD-001)
- End-to-end Supabase ingest still needs an Android device run

## Completed this session (2026-04-23)

- ✅ Reviewed `docs/ops/memory-system-v2.md` and executed the closeout checklist steps that were possible in the current worktree
- ✅ Added `apps/mobile/healthConnectCollector.ts` as the shared Health Connect collector and wired `WearableSyncScreen` to submit a real sync request
- ✅ Expanded the wearable permission surface and aligned mobile docs/assertions to the canonical sync contract
- ✅ Promoted durable notes into `MEMORY.md` and wrote/archived `memory/2026-04-23.md`
- ✅ Closed stale GitHub PRs `#96`, `#97`, `#98`, and `#100` as superseded by later work on `main`
- ✅ Closed issue `#104` as completed after confirming the runtime scoring call-site is now live on `main`
- ✅ Restored local `main` to track `origin/main` and ignored local-only files `apps/mobile/.env` and `apps/mobile/android/app/debug.keystore`
- ✅ Added a canonical Supabase agent workflow at `docs/ops/supabase-agent-workflow.md` and wired `AGENTS.md` to require it for larger Supabase work

## Completed previous session (2026-04-22)

- ✅ Biomarker scoring audit — weighting hierarchy validated against Medicine 3.0 / Attia framework
- ✅ `evidenceConfidenceModifier` + `scoringClass` fields specified on `BiomarkerDefinition` interface
- ✅ `evaluateTriglycerides()` evaluator defined (LIP-003; optimalMax 100 mg/dL)
- ✅ `evaluateDAO()` evaluator defined (CTX-003; LOW_CONFIDENCE flagged; modifier 0.3)
- ✅ Threshold deltas documented: ApoB optimalMax → 60; Vitamin D optimalMin → 40; HbA1c/Glucose/CRP/LDL synced to `thresholds.ts`
- ✅ `AUDIT_LOG.md` updated with full delta table + sources
- ✅ `CHECKPOINT.md` updated
- ✅ Expo mobile restart path unblocked by adding a runtime JS config-plugin entrypoint at `apps/mobile/plugins/with-health-connect.js`
- ✅ `npm run start` now reaches Expo project startup in `apps/mobile`

## Completed previous session (2026-04-21)

- ✅ Repo cleanup: 11 stale branches deleted
- ✅ Issues #95, #94, #89 closed (duplicates + already-merged)
- ✅ Auto-delete branches on merge activated (GitHub repo setting)
- ✅ `AGENTS.md` — output standards section added (commit messages, secrets, session closeout, issue hygiene)

## Next steps

1. Run the new wearable collector on a physical Android device and verify one end-to-end sync into Supabase.
2. Merge `claude/real-app-install-id` when ready.
3. Triage the remaining draft PRs `#99` and `#101` for merge, split, or closure.

## Deferred to post-v1

- **Garmin Terra webhook** — Terra OAuth pairing + `wearable_observations` smoke-test (WEARABLE-TD-002); blocked on physical Garmin device and Terra OAuth credentials; not on critical path for sideload-to-brother milestone
